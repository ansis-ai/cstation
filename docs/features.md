# Features

Control Station (cstation) offers a range of features designed to streamline server management.

## Core Features

### Server Management

- **List Servers**: View all configured servers from your inventory files. Displays group, hostname, and connection details (IP/hostname, user, port).

## Key Benefits

- **Simplified Server Overview**: Quickly get a list of all your managed servers and their basic connection information.
- **Centralized Inventory**: Relies on standard Ansible-like inventory files (`etc/inventory/`) for server definitions.

## Future Features (Planned)

While the current version focuses on listing servers, future enhancements may include:

- **Server Information**: Detailed information about specific servers.
- **Remote Command Execution**: Run commands on managed servers.
- **Code Quality Tools**: Integration of linting, formatting, and static analysis tools.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom commands and integrations.
